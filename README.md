### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Andreas and I studied at the TU Braunschweig Machine Engineering (Master of Science, finished in March. 2020) with the focus on mechatronics. A wide and interesting field, which brings new challenges every day!

Iâ€™m currently learning [Webdevelopment](https://ah2021.github.io/website/) with HTML, CSS and JavaScript  in my free time and Iâ€™m trying to improve my Skills with Data Science using Python. ðŸ’»
