### Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Andreas and I studied Mechatronic Engineering at TU Braunschweig (Master of Science, finished in March 2020) with a focus on Machine Learning and Software Development. A broad and interesting field that brings new challenges every day!

In my spare time I'm currently learning web development with HTML, CSS and JavaScript and trying to improve my data science skills with Python. At work I use T-SQL and C# (.NET Framework) to build GUIs and databases.
